                "Section 1: Application Process Basics\n" + //
                "Q1: What are the typical application components for college admission?\n" + //
                "A1: Most college applications require:\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Application Form: Personal details, academic history.\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "High School Transcripts: Official record of courses and grades.\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Standardized Test Scores: SAT or ACT (though many schools are now test-optional).\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Essays/Personal Statement: A chance to share your story and personality.\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Letters of Recommendation: From teachers, counselors, or mentors.\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Extracurricular Activities List: Showcasing your involvement outside academics.\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Application Fee: Or a fee waiver if eligible.\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Q2: When is the best time to start preparing for college applications?\n" + //
                "A2: It's ideal to start thinking about college in your freshman or sophomore year of high school. This allows you to build a strong academic record, participate in meaningful extracurriculars, and prepare for standardized tests. The actual application process typically begins in the summer before your senior year.\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Q3: What's the difference between Early Decision (ED) and Early Action (EA)?\n" + //
                "A3:\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Early Decision (ED): This is a binding agreement. If you are accepted, you are committed to attending that university and must withdraw all other applications. You can only apply ED to one school.\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Early Action (EA): This is non-binding. You apply early and receive an early decision, but you are not obligated to enroll. You can apply EA to multiple schools.\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Q4: What is a \"holistic review\" in college admissions?\n" + //
                "A4: Holistic review is an admission process that considers an applicant's full range of experiences and attributes, not just academic metrics. It looks at grades, test scores, essays, recommendations, extracurriculars, background, and unique talents to assess a student's potential contribution to the campus community.\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Section 2: Academic & Test Score Information\n" + //
                "Q5: How important is GPA in college admissions?\n" + //
                "A5: GPA is very important as it reflects your academic performance over time. However, colleges also consider the rigor of your coursework (e.g., AP, IB, Honors classes) and your class rank, if provided. A high GPA in challenging courses is often more impactful.\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Q6: Should I submit my SAT/ACT scores if the college is test-optional?\n" + //
                "A6: If your scores are strong (at or above the median for admitted students at that institution), submitting them can strengthen your application. If your scores are lower or you feel they don't accurately represent your abilities, you might choose not to submit them, especially if other parts of your application are very strong.\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Q7: What if my high school doesn't offer many AP/IB courses?\n" + //
                "A7: Colleges understand that not all high schools offer the same opportunities. They will evaluate your academic record within the context of your school. Focus on excelling in the most rigorous courses available to you and demonstrating intellectual curiosity through other means (e.g., independent projects, online courses).\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Section 3: Extracurriculars & Essays\n" + //
                "Q8: How many extracurricular activities should I list on my application?\n" + //
                "A8: Quality over quantity is key. Colleges prefer to see deep involvement and leadership in a few activities rather than superficial participation in many. Aim for activities that genuinely interest you and demonstrate skills like teamwork, leadership, creativity, or commitment.\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Q9: What makes a good college essay?\n" + //
                "A9: A strong college essay is authentic, personal, and reveals something unique about you that isn't evident elsewhere in your application. It should answer the prompt effectively, showcase your writing skills, and tell a compelling story or share a meaningful reflection. Avoid clich√©s and generic statements.\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Q10: Who should I ask for letters of recommendation?\n" + //
                "A10: Choose teachers who know you well, can speak to your academic abilities and character, and in whose classes you performed well. It's also good to ask a counselor or someone who has seen your leadership or commitment in an extracurricular setting. Ask early and provide them with information about your goals and the colleges you're applying to.\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Section 4: Financial Aid & Scholarships\n" + //
                "Q11: What is the FAFSA, and why is it important?\n" + //
                "A11: FAFSA stands for Free Application for Federal Student Aid. It's the primary form used by the U.S. government and many colleges to determine your eligibility for federal student aid (grants, loans, work-study) and often institutional aid. It's crucial to complete it accurately and on time.\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Q12: How do I find scholarships?\n" + //
                "A12: Scholarships can be found through various sources:\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "College-specific scholarships: Many universities offer their own merit-based or need-based scholarships.\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "National scholarship databases: Websites like Fastweb, Scholarship.com, and BigFuture.\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Local community organizations: High school counselors often have information on local scholarships.\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Organizations related to your interests/major: Professional associations or non-profits.\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Section 5: Post-Application & Decision\n" + //
                "Q13: What does it mean to be \"waitlisted\"?\n" + //
                "A13: Being waitlisted means you are a qualified applicant, but the university doesn't have space for you at the moment. You are put in a pool of applicants who might be offered admission later if spots become available. If waitlisted, you can often send a \"letter of continued interest\" to reaffirm your desire to attend.\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Q14: What should I do after receiving an admission offer?\n" + //
                "A14:\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Review the offer: Check the admitted major, financial aid package, and any conditions.\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Visit campus (if possible): Attend admitted student events to get a better feel for the university.\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Compare offers: If you have multiple offers, weigh the pros and cons of each, including cost, academic programs, and campus culture.\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Make your decision: Notify the university of your acceptance or declination by the stated deadline (usually May 1st for regular decision).\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Section 6: Common Scenarios & Advice\n" + //
                "Scenario 1: Student is worried about a lower GPA in freshman year.\n" + //
                "Advice: Explain that colleges often look for an upward trend in grades. Focus on strong performance in sophomore, junior, and senior years, especially in challenging courses. Address any specific reasons for the lower grades in an \"additional information\" section of the application if appropriate.\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Scenario 2: Student is unsure about their major.\n" + //
                "Advice: Many students apply as \"undecided\" or choose a broad major (e.g., \"Arts & Sciences\"). Emphasize exploring interests during college. Highlight diverse academic interests and intellectual curiosity in essays.\n" + //
                "\n" + //
                "Scenario 3: Student has a unique talent or experience.\n" + //
                "Advice: Encourage the student to highlight this prominently in their essays and extracurricular list. This unique aspect can make their application stand out.\n" + //
